# House_Price_Prediction_using_Linear_Regression
In this tutorial you will learn how to create Machine Learning Linear Regression Model. You will be analyzing a house price predication dataset for finding out price of house on different parameters. You will do Exploratory Data Analysis, split the training and testing data, Model Evaluation and Predictions.

# Problem Statement
A real state agents want the help to predict the house price for regions in the USA. He gave you the dataset to work on and you decided to use Linear Regressioon Model. Create a model which will help him to estimate of what the house would sell for.

Dataset contains 7 columns and 5000 rows with CSV extension.
